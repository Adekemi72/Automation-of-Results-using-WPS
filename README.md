Automating Student Results with WPS 
‎
‎One of the projects I recently worked on was practicing how to automate a WAEC-style result sheet using Excel.
‎---
## ‎The goal was:
- when you select an exam number, it should automatically display the student’s name, subjects, and grades.(waec format)
- when you select the name, it should automatically display the student’s picture, gender, subjects, and grades.(school format)

## I made use of VLOOKUP, FILTER function, DATA VALIDATION (drop-down )  to achieve this.

## ‎This practice helped me sharpen my skills in data automation, problem-solving, and Excel functions.
